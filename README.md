(Grocery Hub)
This an application that I builded with react-js.
This ia a grocery shop.
Here you can add product dynamically(name, image,price etc) and they will appear to the home page.
Also can mange product like update or delete product from the database or view existing product list.
User can log in with google, facebook and create new account.
Super fast and responsive design for every page.
