# Grocery Hub project with react
(Grocery Hub)
This an application that I builded with react-js and nodeMongo for backend.
This ia a grocery shop.
Here you can add product dynamically(name, image,price etc) and they will appear to the home page.
Also can mange product like update or delete product from the database or view existing product list.
Evrything is stored in database, so no worries about data loss.
User can log in with google, facebook and create new account.
Super fast and responsive design for every page.
